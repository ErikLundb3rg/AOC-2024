# 2 4 => B = B % () = lowest 3 bits of B
# 1 1 => B = B ^ 0b000001
# 7 5 => C = A // (2**B)
# 0 3 => A = A // (2**3)
# 1 4 => B = B ^ 4 
# 4 0 => B = B ^ C
# 5 5 => output: B % 8
# 3 0 => jump to 0
# reverse engineer such that 
# last 3 digits of B is Y (the target)
# 
# then ^ 4
# multiply A register by 8
# muresltiply C register by A *
